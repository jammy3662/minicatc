## Mini Cat Compiler

Use this tool to compile a Cat-like syntax into C source code and header files.
Access a more powerful type system and compiler control, compile to lightning-fast pure C code.

> Some of the files used in this source are (currently) unavailable in this repository. This is because these files are shared among other projects, and I haven't learned how to properly use git submodules to embed that common code in all relevant repositories. This is a temporary limitation which will be fixed in a later commit. For the moment, you can find the files which need to be included from the LRE repository (Lagoon Rendering Engine).
